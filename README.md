# ***Another_weather_app***
 
 This is my weather app. There are many like it but this one is mine. 
My weather app is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life. 
Without me, my weather app is useless. Without my weather app I am useless.

### **Overview**
* Weather app using open-mateo API to pull weather data.
* Lists weather for next seven days.

### **Technology used**
* Python
* JSON import from API calls

### **What I learned**
* API integration
* I/O object behaviors when working with JSON files
* Use of dictionaries and List comprehension for merging key/value pairsrather than 100 lines of elif to match pairs.
* More python syntax around it to avoid keyvalue errors from null data.
